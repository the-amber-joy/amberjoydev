# Slow Cooker White Chicken Chili

It took me a few iterations to get this recipe exactly how I wanted it and now it's one of my favorites!

## Ingredients

|||
|-------------|-------------|
| 1.25 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs | 6 oz chicken stock (or water + chicken bouillon)
| 1 medium onion, diced | 1 tsp salt
| 1 tsp minced garlic (about 1 clove if using fresh) | 1 tsp cumin
| 2x 15oz cans great northern beans | 1/2 tsp black or white pepper
| 2x 4oz cans diced green chilis | 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste if you like it real spicy!)
| 1x 5oz can evaporated milk | 

## Instructions

- Put all ingredients EXCEPT evaporated milk into slow cooker.
- Cook on low for 6-8 hours (or less time on high).
- Use a large spoon or fork to mix and shred the chicken thighs. The chicken should be very tender and shred easily!
- Stir in evaporated milk and serve immediately. Makes about 6 servings.
