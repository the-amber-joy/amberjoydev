# Creamy Spinach Artichoke Chicken Stew

This creamy chicken stew is spinach-artichoke dip reimagined as a simple stovetop braise. It
comes together quickly, thanks to frozen spinach and jarred artichoke hearts, though if you
have time, there is also a slow-cooker version of this recipe. Fresh dill and scallions are
added just before serving, and provide bright, herbal flavor that offsets the richness of the
finished dish.

## Ingredients
- 2 Tb unsalted butter
- 1 large yellow or red onion, finely chopped
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3 celery stalks, chopped
- 8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped
- 2 cups chicken stock
- ¾ cup white wine
- 2 to 2¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- ½ lemon, juiced (about 1½ Tb)
- 1 tsp red-pepper flakes
- 1 (10-ounce) package frozen cut spinach
- 1 (12-ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained (about 1 heaping cup artichoke hearts)
- ½ cup cream cheese (about 4 ounces)
- ½ cup finely chopped fresh dill
- 4 to 6 scallions, thinly sliced, for topping
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for topping

## Instructions

1. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, season
lightly with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 5
minutes. Add the celery and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes, adjusting
the heat as necessary to avoid scorching. Stir in the garlic.
2. Pour in the stock and wine, and bring to a bubble. Add the chicken thighs, lemon juice
and red-pepper flakes; season with 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper.
Mix well to combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
4. Add the frozen spinach and the artichoke hearts to the pot. Increase the heat to
medium-high and cook, stirring to help the spinach defrost and wilt into the stew. When
the spinach is warm and evenly distributed, reduce the heat and simmer until the
chicken is tender and the flavors are blended, another 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Add the cream cheese in dollops, stirring to melt it into the soup. Add the dill. Using two
forks, coarsely break or shred the chicken into large chunks. Taste and add more salt
and black pepper if necessary.
6. Divide the stew among bowls, and top with scallions and Parmesan.
