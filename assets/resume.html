<h2>Summary</h2>
An independent, motivated learner, avid technophile, and an eager early adopter of new technologies, I have worked as a field archaeologist, an administrative specialist, and an asset-management professional with the Veritas (formerly Symantec) NetBackup development team, and I'm now making a career transition into software development. I am passionate about lifelong learning, constant self-improvement, and finding new ways for technology to help improve our lives. My experience includes spoken and written communications; developing and writing software applications (as an individual, and in group & pair dynamics); active learning; critical thinking; troubleshooting & problem-solving; and time & resource management.
