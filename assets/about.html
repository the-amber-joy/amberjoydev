These StrengthsFinder results are a fantastic description of how I operate. I am happiest existing in my mind, always looking to collect and digest all kinds of new information and skills - learning has always been a lifelong passion for me, whether teaching myself to <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/amberica" target="_blank">knit</a>, learning about (and practicing) the fascinating biomechanics of <a href="/assets/images/135squat.jpg" target="_blank">lifting heavy things</a>, or picking up a <a href="http://www.esperanto.net/info/index_en.html" target="_blank">new</a> <a href="http://omniglot.com/writing/latin2.htm" target="_blank">language</a> (<a href="http://www.omniglot.com/chinese/mandarin.htm" target="_blank">human</a> OR software!), and I am thrilled to be entering a field where perpetual learning is not only encouraged, but required in order to stay relevant.

I worked very briefly as a field archaeologist right out of college, then decided to transition into office jobs where the weather didn't affect my ability to work. But in my own time, I've always been a technophile, and found myself feeling very at-home with the software development team I supported at Symantec Corporation (now Veritas Technologies). However, I was always interested in getting "behind the code" someday, and am very excited to be making that move now.
