                    These StrengthsFinder results are a fantastic description of how I operate. I am happiest existing in my mind, always looking to collect and digest all kinds of new information and skills - learning has always been a lifelong passion for me, whether teaching
                    myself to <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/amberica" target="_blank">knit</a>, learning about (and practicing) the fascinating biomechanics of <a href="/assets/images/135squat.jpg" target="_blank">lifting heavy things</a>,
                    or picking up a <a href="http://www.esperanto.net/info/index_en.html" target="_blank">new</a> <a href="http://omniglot.com/writing/latin2.htm" target="_blank">language</a> (<a href="http://www.omniglot.com/chinese/mandarin.htm" target="_blank">human</a> OR <a href="http://codingbat.com/java" target="_blank">software</a>!), and I am thrilled to be entering a field where perpetual learning is not only encouraged, but required in order to stay relevant.

                <p class="justifytext">
                    I worked very briefly as a field archaeologist right out of college, then decided to transition into office jobs where the weather didn't affect my ability to work. But in my own time, I've always been a technophile, and found myself
                    feeling very at-home with the software development team I supported at Symantec Corporation (now Veritas Technologies). However, I was always interested in getting "behind the code" someday, and am very excited to be making that move now.

                    An independent, motivated learner, avid technophile, and an eager early adopter of new technologies, I have worked as a field archaeologist, an administrative specialist, and an asset-management professional with the Veritas (formerly Symantec) NetBackup
                    development team, and I'm now making a career transition into software development. I am passionate about lifelong learning, constant self-improvement, and finding new ways for technology to help improve our lives. My experience includes
                    spoken and written communications; developing and writing software applications (as an individual, and in group &amp; pair dynamics); active learning; critical thinking; troubleshooting &amp; problem-solving; and time &amp; resource
                    management.
