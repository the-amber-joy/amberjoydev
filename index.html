                These StrengthsFinder results are a fantastic description of how I operate. I am happiest existing in my mind, always looking to collect and digest all kinds of new information and skills - learning has always been a lifelong passion for me, whether teaching
                myself to <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/amberica" target="_blank">knit</a>, learning about (and practicing) the fascinating biomechanics of <a href="/assets/images/135squat.jpg" target="_blank">lifting heavy things</a>,

                I worked very briefly as a field archaeologist right out of college, then decided to transition into office jobs where the weather didn't affect my ability to work. But in my own time, I've always been a technophile, and found myself feeling very at-home
                with the software development team I supported at Symantec Corporation (now Veritas Technologies). However, I was always interested in getting "behind the code" someday, and am very excited to be making that move now.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p class="justifytext">
                An independent, motivated learner, avid technophile, and an eager early adopter of new technologies, I have worked as a field archaeologist, an administrative specialist, and an asset-management professional with the Veritas (formerly Symantec) NetBackup
                development team, and I'm now making a career transition into software development. I am passionate about lifelong learning, constant self-improvement, and finding new ways for technology to help improve our lives. My experience includes
                spoken and written communications; developing and writing software applications (as an individual, and in group &amp; pair dynamics); active learning; critical thinking; troubleshooting &amp; problem-solving; and time &amp; resource management.
